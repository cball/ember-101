# Ember 101 Workshop

This repository is for the [Free Ember Workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Louisville/events/233039212/) hosted by [Ember.js Louisville](https://emberlou.com) and sponsored by [TEKsystems](https://www.teksystems.com/) and [Echobind](https://echobind.com).

## About

Join us for a free workshop!

In this workshop, you'll learn how to make an Ember application using Ember CLI.

We will discuss the core concepts around Ember, and why it can be a great option for your next project. This workshop is a great opportunity for Louisville developers to get real-world Ember experience. The feedback from a similar workshop we sponsored in [San Diego](http://www.meetup.com/sandiego-ember/events/228231120/) was excellent, and some of those developers have gone on to use Ember in their careers.

We welcome people of all backgrounds and skill levels, and it is strongly encouraged that attendees have an understanding of HTML and CSS. Volunteers will be available to give personalized attention and answer questions. You can reach out to [@michaelyared](https://twitter.com/michaelyared) with any questions about the class. Please be friendly, welcoming, and respectful. 

We have adopted the Louisville.io [Code of Conduct](http://louisville.io/code-of-conduct.html).
