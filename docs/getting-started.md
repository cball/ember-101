# Ready to code!

Now that we have reviewed the contents Ember CLI sets us up with for development, we are ready to get coding. One of the many commands Ember CLI provides us is `serve` which will launch the server with live-reload. Any time we make changes to the application we should see this instantly reflected in any of the browser we have open to the server.

0. `ember serve`
0. Visit [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser and you should see a message that says "Congratulations, you made it!" with a friendly Tomster wearing a construction hat. 

# Install Bootstrap

Let's use Bootstrap to make our website look nice. This step isn't strictly necessary but it'll make our application snazzier without us having to do much styling work.

```console
$ bower install bootstrap --save
```

Now we need to include the Bootstrap CSS into our build process.  Let's add the following to our `ember-cli-build.js` just above `return app.toTree();`:

```js
app.import('bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css');
```

Our `ember-cli-build.js` should look something like this now:

```js
/*jshint node:true*/
/* global require, module */
var EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');

module.exports = function(defaults) {
  var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    // Add options here
  });

  // Use `app.import` to add additional libraries to the generated
  // output files.
  //
  // If you need to use different assets in different
  // environments, specify an object as the first parameter. That
  // object's keys should be the environment name and the values
  // should be the asset to use in that environment.
  //
  // If the library that you are including contains AMD or ES6
  // modules that you would like to import into your application
  // please specify an object with the list of modules as keys
  // along with the exports of each module as its value.

  // Add bootstrap to our build
  app.import('bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css');

  return app.toTree();
};
```

**ProTipâ„¢** As we mentioned before, ember-cli uses live-reloading to persist changes to the browser without the need of reloading. As long as `http://localhost:4200/` is open, you'll see changes immediately. Neat! However, if you edit `ember-cli-build.js`, like we just did in this step, you will need to **kill** and **restart** `ember serve`. Then refresh `http://localhost:4200/`.

The font of our header should have changed.

Now let's add a big header introducing our blog.  Let's update our `application.hbs` file to add a jumbotron header and wrap our page content in a Bootstrap `container`:

```handlebars
{% raw %}
<div class="jumbotron">
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Bernice's Blog</h1>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="container">
  {{outlet}}
</div>
{% endraw %}
```

Our site should have refreshed in our web browser now, revealing a big header for our blog.
