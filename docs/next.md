# Continue Learning

The [Ember guides][ember-guides] are great for diving deep once you understand the fundamentals. They're also versioned so you can be sure you're looking at accurate information for whatever version you happen to be working with.

The book [Rock n' Roll with Ember.js][rnr-ember] by **Balinti Erdi** slowly introduces concepts and best practices as you build an Ember application. It does an excellent job of walking through major concepts and enabling you to build complete applications.

If you're looking to extend your application with addons, visit [Ember Observer][eo]. Ember Observer is a curated site of addons which is searchable and sortable by maintainer or category.

Ready to explore newer and more advanced aspects of Ember? Check out **Mike North's** multi-part blog post titled [Building a performant real-time web app with Ember Fastboot and Phoenix][mnorth].

Learn about authentication in **Vikram Narayan's** blog post: [Authentication with Ember and Firebase - A Newbie Friendly Guide][vnarayan].

Rails developers can visit [From Rails to Ember][cball] by **Chris Ball**  to learn about the similarities and differences between the two frameworks.
